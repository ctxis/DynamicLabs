# Default Lab Templates Documentation

The default lab templates shipped with Dynamic Labs are located in the ``Templates`` directory and are grouped according to the following types:

* ``exercises`` - Lab templates that include a single intentional vulnerability. Useful for practicing a single attack technique such as kerberoasting.
* ``attack-paths`` - Lab templates that include multiple vulnerabilities that can be chained to form a high impact attack path. Useful for self-studying or general training.
* ``demos`` - Lab templates that implement common environments, such as an Active Directory forests. Useful for research purposes or as a starting point in the [development of new lab templates](template_development.md). These templates do not include intentional vulnerabilities; however these environments are not hardened in any meaningful way and may include unintentional and potentially exploitable weaknesses.
* ``training`` - Larger templates used in internal training courses. Not available in the community version of Dynamic Labs.
